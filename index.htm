	    <h1>About</h1>
		<img src= "mose.jpg" alt = "FRED MOSE PIC">
		<p>I am a recent Systems Engineering graduate from Simon Fraser University.
		   I have a strong passion for design and development of both hardware and 
		   software systems and a strong belief in the value of continuous improvement. 
		   My experience from Co-op in Software development and testing as well as my 
		   own personal projects, has reinforced in me the value of creative problem 
		   solving and the power of collaborative design.</p>
